# StockTracker

## Description

StockTracker is an application for managing a stock portfolio.

## Downloads

Releases can be downloaded [here](https://www.larrymtaylor.com/software.php).

## Contributing

Contributions that enhance StockTracker or fix bugs are very much 
appreciated. However, please note that I can't promise that all 
contributions will be accepted.

### Use Github Issues and Pull Requests

If you're capable of implementing the feature or bug fix yourself,
please open a pull request rather than opening an issue.

If you're not able to make the change yourself, please open an issue
after checking to be sure there's not already an existing open issue.

Contributions must be submitted using Github. Contributions sent as
code dumps via email are difficult to merge in, don't promote discussion
and iteration, and don't leave a comment trail explaining the change.

### Code style

StockTracker doesn't have a style guide document, but its
style should be easy to infer by reading the existing code. Please try
to match this style closely. Two rules are mandatory: 1) no tabs;
and, 2) indents are four spaces.
